spatialite (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release with partial repackaing to cope with upstream changes.
  * New upstream packaging: now this package includes all spatialite-related 
    tarballs to provide the whole set of binary packages, based on the 
    amalgameted sources.
  * Added quilt support. Now the upstream tarball is included as a
    compressed archive to facilitate interactive cleanaups and patching.
  * [PATCH] split.diff removes embedded sqlite3 and uses system library.
    The patch is built by autoreconfiguring a suitable fixed automake
    root file.
  * [PATCH] tools.diff allows building without pre-installation and fixes use
    of static libs instead of libtools helpers for external libraries.
  * Removed superfluous removing of *-stamp files.
  * Removed init SQL file, initialization is now embedded in the library.
  * Removed README installation: it documents purely installation.
  * Currently still does not build spatialite-gui.
  * Now the library is distributed under MPL 1.1, tools under GPL-3: changed
    debian/copyright to explain that.
  * Now adds pkg-config support (fixed for Debian use).
    (closes: #519251)
