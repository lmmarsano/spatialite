spatialite (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release with API change and new SONAME.
  * A new single sqlite3_libtool.diff patch introduced to use system-wide
    sqlite3 stuff and drop the libtool helpers use for sqlite3, geos and proj.
    (closes: #567615)
  * Revised the get-orig-source to work with a single upstream archive.
    That renders the archive compatible with dpkg format 3.0.
    (closes: #538566)
  * Now use libreadline-dev as build-dep.
    (closes: #553855)
  * Do not install spatialite .la file as well.
  * Added Vcs-* fields.
  * Policy bumped to 3.8.4.

spatialite (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release with partial repackaing to cope with upstream changes.
  * New upstream packaging: now this package includes all spatialite-related 
    tarballs to provide the whole set of binary packages, based on the 
    amalgameted sources.
  * Added quilt support. Now the upstream tarball is included as a
    compressed archive to facilitate interactive cleanaups and patching.
  * [PATCH] split.diff removes embedded sqlite3 and uses system library.
    The patch is built by autoreconfiguring a suitable fixed automake
    root file.
  * [PATCH] tools.diff allows building without pre-installation and fixes use
    of static libs instead of libtools helpers for external libraries.
  * Removed superfluous removing of *-stamp files.
  * Removed init SQL file, initialization is now embedded in the library.
  * Removed README installation: it documents purely installation.
  * Currently still does not build spatialite-gui.
  * Now the library is distributed under MPL 1.1, tools under GPL-3: changed
    debian/copyright to explain that.
  * Now adds pkg-config support (fixed for Debian use).
    (closes: #519251)
