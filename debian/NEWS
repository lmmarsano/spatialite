spatialite (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from this release Spatialite library and Spatialtools have been
  decoupled in two different sources as in upstream kits. Each of them now
  follows its own releasing process and has its own version.

spatialite (3.0.0~beta20110817-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  From this release, powerpc will lack full EPSG initialization.
  .
  This means that spatialite won't support all EPSG projections,
  but only a small subset. The list of supported projections can be
  found in '/usr/share/doc/libspatialite-dev/EPSG.powerpc'.
