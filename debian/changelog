spatialite (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    (closes: #661018)
  * Patchset refreshed. Finally, Sandro is now following a sane policy with 
    SONAME versioning. Better than never.
  * This version is compatible with Freexl >= 1.0.0 only.
  * Now spatialite source includes the library only, spatialite-tools moved
    to a new package.
  * Rules script greatly semplified.
  * For safety added a Breaks against previous version of spatialite-bin,
    that should allow a more smooth upgrade with new splitted packages.
  * Force Geos 3.3+ use for a working test suite.
  * Policy bumped to 3.9.3. No changes required.
  * Added a patch 05-dont_relink.patch to avoid (superfluous) relinking against
    the C++ geos library. It now causes a failure at configuration time
    because the C/C++ libraries are now splitted.
  * Added a 06-fix_soname.patch patch to use a correct SONAME versioning.
  * Symbol file updated for current 3.0.1.

  * New upstream packaging: now this package includes all spatialite-related

    amalgameted sources.
  * Added quilt support. Now the upstream tarball is included as a
    compressed archive to facilitate interactive cleanaups and patching.

    The patch is built by autoreconfiguring a suitable fixed automake
    root file.

    of static libs instead of libtools helpers for external libraries.

    debian/copyright to explain that.
