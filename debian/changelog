spatialite (2.4.0~rc2-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Alan Boudreault ]
  * Added spatialite_tool and spatialite_osm binaries in spatialite-bin.
  * Changed build-dep libsqlite3-dev to (>= 3.6.11): spatialite uses "hot backup"
    interface of sqlite3.
    (closes: #576743)
  * VirtualText has been updated long time ago.
    (closes: #530422)

spatialite (2.4.0~rc2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now -dev package depends also on libsqlite3-dev.
  * Added a symlink for sqlite3.h within /usr/include/spatialite because other
    softwares could look for that at configure time (e.g. ATM gdal).

spatialite (2.4.0~rc2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Restored right version of .install file.
    (closes: #577568)

spatialite (2.4.0~rc2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wrong dependency in the -dev package, still around after
    libtool version change.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Sun, 04 Apr 2010 08:07:52 +0200

spatialite (2.4.0~rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release candidate.
  * A new mega-patch systemlibs.diff introduced to use system-wide
    sqlite3 stuff and drop the libtool helpers use for sqlite3, geos and proj.
    Also changed libtool versioning to avoid not proper SONAME bumping, after
    a private thread with Sandro.
    (closes: #567615)
  * Revised the get-orig-source to work with a single upstream archive.
    That renders the archive compatible with dpkg format 3.0.
    (closes: #538566)
  * Now use libreadline-dev as build-dep.
    (closes: #553855)
  * Do not install spatialite .la file as well.
  * Added Vcs-* fields.
  * Policy bumped to 3.8.4.

spatialite (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release with partial repackaing to cope with upstream changes.
  * New upstream packaging: now this package includes all spatialite-related 
    tarballs to provide the whole set of binary packages, based on the 
    amalgameted sources.
  * Added quilt support. Now the upstream tarball is included as a
    compressed archive to facilitate interactive cleanaups and patching.
  * [PATCH] split.diff removes embedded sqlite3 and uses system library.
    The patch is built by autoreconfiguring a suitable fixed automake
    root file.
  * [PATCH] tools.diff allows building without pre-installation and fixes use
    of static libs instead of libtools helpers for external libraries.
  * Removed superfluous removing of *-stamp files.
  * Removed init SQL file, initialization is now embedded in the library.
  * Removed README installation: it documents purely installation.
  * Currently still does not build spatialite-gui.
  * Now the library is distributed under MPL 1.1, tools under GPL-3: changed
    debian/copyright to explain that.
  * Now adds pkg-config support (fixed for Debian use).
    (closes: #519251)
