spatialite (3.0.0~beta20110817-3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  From this release, powerpc will lack full EPSG initialization.
  .
  This means that spatialite won't support all EPSG projections,
  but only a small subset. The list of supported projections can be
  found in '/usr/share/doc/libspatialite-dev/EPSG.powerpc'.
